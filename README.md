# Public-Code
The code in this branch consists of code that I've written in various languages after discussing different ideas or approaches to common problems with friends and coworkers;
and things that I made for fun and out of curiosity. As of 2021-03-05, when I'm writing this description, most of it has no any practical purpose or inclusion within any larger projects. The JSON parsing/generating code (json.cpp, json.h, and json_test.cpp), the most recent c++ permutation algorithm, and the variable dumping subroutine for Perl are a couple of exceptions. It's also worth mentioning that most of the code is not indicative of my typical coding style or approach, as the majority of the code here was not created for professional consumption. On that note, it's worth mentioning that my earlier code used hungarian notation, while my later code switched to a mixture of hungarian notation and snake case, which I find to be more descriptive and easier to read.
